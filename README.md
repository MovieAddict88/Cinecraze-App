## Data Fetching Fixes and Improvements

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Network Security Configuration**: Added proper network security configuration to allow HTTPS connections to GitHub raw content
2. **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling with user feedback via Toast messages
3. **Network State Checking**: Added network connectivity checks before making API calls

10. **TV Series Player**: Fixed player handling for TV series with season and episode selectors
11. **Fullscreen Player**: Fixed fullscreen functionality with proper exit handling and player state preservation

### Key Improvements:

- **Network Security**: Added `network_security_config.xml` to allow HTTPS connections
- **Permissions**: Added `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permission for connectivity checks
- **Retrofit Configuration**: Enhanced with logging interceptor and timeout settings
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanism with user feedback
- **Data Validation**: Null checks and empty data handling
- **User Experience**: Better progress indicators and success/error messages
- **API URL Fix**: Updated to use direct raw.githubusercontent.com URL
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed network logging for debugging
- **Timeout Increase**: Extended timeouts to 60 seconds for better reliability
- **Data Type Handling**: Fixed parsing of mixed data types (Rating can be float/int/string, Year can be int/string)
- **TV Series Support**: Added season and episode selectors for TV series with proper player handling
- **Fullscreen Improvements**: Fixed fullscreen exit handling and player state preservation

### API Endpoint:
- **Base URL**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MovieAddict88/Movie-Source/main/`
- **Endpoint**: `playlist.json`
- **Status**: ✅ Working and accessible
- **Fixed**: Updated URL to use direct raw.githubusercontent.com instead of redirecting

### Dependencies Added:
- `com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor:4.9.0` for network logging

### Testing:
The API endpoint has been tested and is returning valid JSON data with movie/streaming content.

### Build and Run:
1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Sync Gradle files (the project now includes proper Gradle configuration)
3. Build and run the app
4. The app will automatically fetch data on startup

### Project Structure:
- `settings.gradle` - Project configuration
- `build.gradle` - Root build configuration
- `app/build.gradle` - App-specific dependencies and configuration
- `app/src/main/res/xml/` - XML configuration files (network security, backup rules, data extraction)

### Fixed Build Issues:
- ✅ Created missing `data_extraction_rules.xml`
- ✅ Created missing `backup_rules.xml`
- ✅ Added proper Gradle configuration files
- ✅ All resource references now resolve correctly

### TV Series Features:
- ✅ Season selector with horizontal scrolling
- ✅ Episode selector with episode details
- ✅ Automatic player switching between episodes
- ✅ Proper handling of TV series vs movies
- ✅ Fallback to movie mode for entries without seasons/episodes

### Player Functionality:
- **Movies**: Direct playback from server URLs
- **TV Series**: Season and episode selection with automatic playback
- **Fullscreen**: Support for both movies and TV series episodes with proper exit handling
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- **Player State**: Preserves playing state when entering/exiting fullscreen

The app should now properly fetch and display streaming content with improved reliability and user experience, including full TV series support with season and episode navigation.
