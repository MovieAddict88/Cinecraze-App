# CineCraze Android App

## Data Fetching Fixes and Improvements

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Network Security Configuration**: Added proper network security configuration to allow HTTPS connections to GitHub raw content
2. **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling with user feedback via Toast messages
3. **Network State Checking**: Added network connectivity checks before making API calls
4. **Retry Mechanism**: Implemented automatic retry logic (up to 3 attempts) for failed network requests
5. **Null Safety**: Added null checks throughout the codebase to prevent crashes
6. **Logging**: Added detailed logging for debugging network issues
7. **Timeout Configuration**: Added proper timeout settings for network requests
8. **Lifecycle Management**: Improved app lifecycle handling to prevent unnecessary API calls

### Key Improvements:

- **Network Security**: Added `network_security_config.xml` to allow HTTPS connections
- **Permissions**: Added `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permission for connectivity checks
- **Retrofit Configuration**: Enhanced with logging interceptor and timeout settings
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanism with user feedback
- **Data Validation**: Null checks and empty data handling
- **User Experience**: Better progress indicators and success/error messages

### API Endpoint:
- **Base URL**: `https://github.com/MovieAddict88/Movie-Source/raw/main/`
- **Endpoint**: `playlist.json`
- **Status**: âœ… Working and accessible

### Dependencies Added:
- `com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor:4.9.0` for network logging

### Testing:
The API endpoint has been tested and is returning valid JSON data with movie/streaming content.

### Build and Run:
1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Sync Gradle files
3. Build and run the app
4. The app will automatically fetch data on startup

The app should now properly fetch and display streaming content with improved reliability and user experience.
